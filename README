This is a tool for MacOS users, that let them login into the VIT wifi automatically

Any bugs/ contributions are welcome...


1. Open terminal and run sh install.sh
2. Run "hal init" to setup you username and password
3. After instalation is done, open System Prefernces 
4. Search for login items, and add the HaL.app which you can find in your Application Folder


Future plans:
1. To make it run the script only if a network change is detected, instead of a loop in the background
   idk how this affects battery life, so optimizations are coming 
2. To expand into the tool into a general purpose tool that can be used to login to any hostspots
3. multiplie profies that will help with differnet wifi logins
4. Finding a way to disable to apple's login page
